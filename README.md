As working at the big tech companies like MAANG becomes extremely popular today, many people turn to seek for an engineer job in IT industry. For those newbies, there are many challenging knowledge/skills to learn whatever they are still in the process of job interviews or got an offer already. I know this because I've been working in the industry over 12 years. I'm currently running teams for different projects. I saw many guys struggling in the job interviews, and even if they already took the offer, they probably still have no clear idea how to make the project professionally for a long time. As a veteran, I used to helping many new engineers to build the software engineering mindset for different reasons. In fact, sharing my experience to others is really a pleasure. Therefore, I decide to start this repo and make the video tutorials to everybody needed.

This repo and relevant tutorials are not designed to be a boring textbook. Instead, it more focuses on the hands-on skills/knowledge which is helpful in interview and real work(hopefully). I'm really hoping it can help somebody even a little bit. I'll keep updating the skills/knowledge as well as the thoughts of the industry. Any suggestions and feedbacks are strongly welcome.

The following is the major catalog for your convenience. The whole repo is organized and made by Obsidian which is one of my favorite tools.
