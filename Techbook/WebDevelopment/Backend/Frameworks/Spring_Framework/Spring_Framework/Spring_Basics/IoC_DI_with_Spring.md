# IoC DI with Spring

[**Original Page**](https://www.baeldung.com/inversion-control-and-dependency-injection-in-spring)


## 1. Overview

In this tutorial, we'll introduce the concepts of IoC (Inversion of Control) and DI (Dependency Injection), as well as take a look at how these are implemented in the Spring framework.

## 2. What Is Inversion of Control?

Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework. We most often use it in the context of object-oriented programming.

In contrast with traditional programming, in which our custom code makes calls to a library, IoC enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code. To enable this, frameworks use abstractions with additional behavior built in. **If we want to add our own behavior, we need to extend the classes of the framework or plugin our own classes.**

The advantages of this architecture are:

-   decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
-   making it easier to switch between different implementations
-   greater modularity of a program
-   greater ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking its dependencies, and allowing components to communicate through contracts

We can achieve Inversion of Control through various mechanisms such as: Strategy design pattern, Service Locator pattern, Factory pattern, and Dependency Injection (DI).
We're going to look at DI next.

## 3. What Is Dependency Injection?

Dependency injection is a pattern we can use to implement IoC, where the control being inverted is setting an object's dependencies.

Connecting objects with other objects, or “injecting” objects into other objects, is done by an assembler rather than by the objects themselves.

Here's how we would create an object dependency in traditional programming:

```Java
public class Store {
    private Item item;
 
    public Store() {
        item = new ItemImpl1();    
    }
}
```

In the example above, we need to instantiate an implementation of the _Item_ interface within the _Store_ class itself.

By using DI, we can rewrite the example without specifying the implementation of the _Item_ that we want:

```Java
public class Store {
    private Item item;
    public Store(Item item) {
        this.item = item;
    }
}
```

In the next sections, we'll look at how we can provide the implementation of _Item_ through metadata.

Both IoC and DI are simple concepts, but they have deep implications in the way we structure our systems, so they're well worth understanding fully.

## 4. The Spring IoC Container

An IoC container is a common characteristic of frameworks that implement IoC.

In the Spring framework, the interface _ApplicationContext_ represents the IoC container. The Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring and assembling objects known as _beans_, as well as managing their life cycles.

The Spring framework provides several implementations of the _ApplicationContext_ interface: _ClassPathXmlApplicationContext_ and _FileSystemXmlApplicationContext_ for standalone applications, and _WebApplicationContext_ for web applications.

In order to assemble beans, the container uses configuration metadata, which can be in the form of XML configuration or annotations.

Here's one way to manually instantiate a container:

```Java
ApplicationContext context
  = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
```

To set the _item_ attribute in the example above, we can use metadata. Then the container will read this metadata and use it to assemble beans at runtime.

**Dependency Injection in Spring can be done through constructors, setters or fields.**

## 5. Constructor-Based Dependency Injection

In the case of [constructor-based dependency injection](https://www.baeldung.com/constructor-injection-in-spring), the container will invoke a constructor with arguments each representing a dependency we want to set.

Spring resolves each argument primarily by type, followed by name of the attribute, and index for disambiguation. Let's see the configuration of a bean and its dependencies using annotations:

```Java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public Item item1() {
        return new ItemImpl1();
    }

    @Bean
    public Store store() {
        return new Store(item1());
    }
}
```

The _@Configuration_ annotation indicates that the class is a source of bean definitions. We can also add it to multiple configuration classes.

We use the _@Bean_ annotation on a method to define a bean. If we don't specify a custom name, then the bean name will default to the method name.

For a bean with the default _singleton_ scope, Spring first checks if a cached instance of the bean already exists, and only creates a new one if it doesn't. If we're using the _prototype_ scope, the container returns a new bean instance for each method call.

Another way to create the configuration of the beans is through XML configuration:

```XML
<bean id="item1" class="org.baeldung.store.ItemImpl1" /> 
<bean id="store" class="org.baeldung.store.Store"> 
    <constructor-arg type="ItemImpl1" index="0" name="item" ref="item1" /> 
</bean>
```

## 6. Setter-Based Dependency Injection

For setter-based DI, the container will call setter methods of our class after invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument static factory method to instantiate the bean. Let's create this configuration using annotations:

```Java
@Bean
public Store store() {
    Store store = new Store();
    store.setItem(item1());
    return store;
}
```

We can also use XML for the same configuration of beans:

```XML
<bean id="store" class="org.baeldung.store.Store">
    <property name="item" ref="item1" />
</bean>
```

We can combine constructor-based and setter-based types of injection for the same bean. The Spring documentation recommends using constructor-based injection for mandatory dependencies, and setter-based injection for optional ones.

## 7. Field-Based  Dependency Injection

In case of Field-Based DI, we can inject the dependencies by marking them with an _@Autowired_ annotation:

```Java
public class Store {
    @Autowired
    private Item item; 
}
```

While constructing the _Store_ object, if there's no constructor or setter method to inject the _Item_ bean, the container will use reflection to inject _Item_ into _Store_.

We can also achieve this using [XML configuration](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-xml-injection).

This approach might look simpler and cleaner, but we don't recommend using it because it has a few drawbacks such as:

-   This method uses reflection to inject the dependencies, which is costlier than constructor-based or setter-based injection.
-   It's really easy to keep adding multiple dependencies using this approach. If we were using constructor injection, having multiple arguments would make us think that the class does more than one thing, which can violate the Single Responsibility Principle.

More information on the _@Autowired_ annotation can be found in the [Wiring In Spring](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-annotations-resource-inject-autowire) article.

## 8. Autowiring Dependencies

[Wiring](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-annotations-resource-inject-autowire) allows the Spring container to automatically resolve dependencies between collaborating beans by inspecting the beans that have been defined.

There are four modes of autowiring a bean using an XML configuration:

-   **_no_:** the default value – this means no autowiring is used for the bean and we have to explicitly name the dependencies.
-   **_byName_:** autowiring is done based on the name of the property, therefore Spring will look for a bean with the same name as the property that needs to be set.
-   **_byType_:** similar to the _byName_ autowiring, only based on the type of the property. This means Spring will look for a bean with the same type of the property to set. If there's more than one bean of that type, the framework throws an exception.
-   **_constructor_:** autowiring is done based on constructor arguments, meaning Spring will look for beans with the same type as the constructor arguments.

For example, let's autowire the _item1_ bean defined above by type into the _store_ bean:

```Java
@Bean(autowire = Autowire.BY_TYPE)
public class Store {
    
    private Item item;

    public setItem(Item item){
        this.item = item;    
    }
}
```

We can also inject beans using the _@Autowired_ annotation for autowiring by type:

```Java
public class Store {
    
    @Autowired
    private Item item;
}
```

If there's more than one bean of the same type, we can use the _@Qualifier_ annotation to reference a bean by name:

```Java
public class Store {
    
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("item1")
    private Item item;
}
```

Now let's autowire beans by type through XML configuration:

```XML
<bean id="store" class="org.baeldung.store.Store" autowire="byType"> </bean>
```

Next, let's inject a bean named _item_ into the _item_ property of _store_ bean by name through XML:

```XML
<bean id="item" class="org.baeldung.store.ItemImpl1" />

<bean id="store" class="org.baeldung.store.Store" autowire="byName">
</bean>
```

We can also override the autowiring by defining dependencies explicitly through constructor arguments or setters.

## 9. Lazy Initialized Beans

By default, the container creates and configures all singleton beans during initialization. To avoid this, we can use the _lazy-init_ attribute with value _true_ on the bean configuration:

```XML
<bean id="item1" class="org.baeldung.store.ItemImpl1" lazy-init="true" />
```

Consequently, the _item1_ bean will only be initialized when it's first requested, and not at startup. The advantage of this is faster initialization time, but the trade-off is that we won't discover any configuration errors until after the bean is requested, which could be several hours or even days after the application has already been running.

## 10. Conclusion
